The low-level operations on Q27 databases are implemented as stand-alone
C++ applications:
1. coronal2 - full exploration (of smaller board sizes) and database generation
   with a pre-placement of the two outer rings.
2. q27db - database statistics, inspection and merger.

Run both programs without arguments for a quick help on operation modes and
their parameters.
